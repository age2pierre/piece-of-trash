# Parcel Typescript React

A simple opinionated boilerplate of how I like to setup my static react projects, including:

- **Parcel** - as the asset bundler (fast, all included and zero config)
- **Typescript** - because being explicit about types is important, configured to be _strict_.
- **React/React-DOM**
- **React Router**
- **Prettier & ESlint** - configured to work together
- VSCode Setup
- Git hooks to lint/format staged files only
- Jest - to run `**/*.test.{ts,tsx}` files

## Instalation

1. Run `npm i` to install packages
1. Run `npm start` to run dev server
1. Hack away

If you use VSCode it is a good idea to install
[Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode),
[ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
and [VSCode React Refactor](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=planbcoding.vscode-react-refactor) extensions.
